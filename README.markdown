# Thought Timer

Ever notice how your train of thought runs, and then is abruptly interrupted by something else, or a loop restarts?

This happens when you get some stimulus from the outside world, but also in a sensory deprivation bath, thoughts still follow a cycle.

I was curious: How long does a thought-cycle usually last?  What might this period tell us about how the mind works?

The Thought Timer is a little device to was built to help measure this question without itself being an interrupt to the natural cycle of thoughts.

- Via Bluetooth LE connect the device to the included webpage.

- Hold the device comfortably in your hand.  Each time you notice an abrupt change in your train of thought or a cycle restarts, press the thumb buttom.

- The webpage will start to build a histogram of the time between train of thought cycles.
